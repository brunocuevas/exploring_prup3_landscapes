# MD

## Contents

In this folder we have what could be recovered from our setups. It was
complicated to gather all fragments of our work due to planning problems,
cluster accounts that were removed, etc. However, we think that these
scripts provide information enough to understand how simulations were
performed

In the scripts folder, we have only the script corresponding to
ligA simulation. The others were lost but they follow the same spirit: simulation
with a previous optimization and equilibration

The files natural ligand have a different file structure since that part was
performed but another of the authors
