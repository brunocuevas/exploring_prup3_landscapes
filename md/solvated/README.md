# PruP3 + sphyngosine/phytosphingosne MD

## Summary

PruP3 is a non-specific lipid transport lipid related with the hypersensibilization
process that takes place in alergia. The purposes of these simulations is to check
how do sphyingosine and phytosphyingosine, two of the ligands of this protein, behave
when bound to this protein.

## Contents

LTP has an internal tunnel with two possible entrances, A and B, so two different
conformational inputs were considered for each of the molecules. Therefore, there
are four ligands. Each folder should be self-consistent.

- *prup3_ps_A* phytosphingosine in conformation A
- *prup3_ps_B* phytosphingosine in conformation B
- *prup3_s_A* sphingosine in conformation A
- *prup3_s_B* sphingosine in conformation B

## Workflow

For each input folder:

1. Run NAMD optimization
2. Run NAMD equilibration
3. Run NAMD simulation

There is an NAMD input file for each of those tasks.
