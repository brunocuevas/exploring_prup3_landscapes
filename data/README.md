# Data

Most of the data was analyzed on the run from the molecular
trajectories, so there are not many data files. On the other hand,
collective variables results regarding metadynamics bias should be
in the metadynamics folder. Refer to the notebooks to see
where did data came from.

The two folders here refer:
1. to energy calculations using MM-PBSA/PCA-entropy
2. to collective variables studied in the unbiased molecular dynamics
